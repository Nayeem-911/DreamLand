                <p>There are plenty of reasons to travel to Switzerland. We cant even try and dissuade you from it by saying its one of the most expensive countries in the world. Switzerland is busting at the seams with alpine lakes, dramatic cliff faces, mountains, modern cities, flower-filled meadows, charming villages like Grindelwald, fresh air, alphorns, and free-roaming dairy cows. Its easy to see the allure.</p>
                <p>Switzerlands economic development has been affected by specific physical and cultural geographic factors. In the first instance, the country has few raw materials; precipitation and soil quality largely determine the type and size of cultivation; urban and industrial expansion encroach on the limited amount of cultivable land; the commerce and transport sectors have benefited from Switzerlands central location along international trade routes; and tourism has been boosted by the landscapes exceptional scenic beauty, including glacial peaks and Alpine lakes. In the second instance, the inability of the countrys small domestic market to absorb the total output of a skilled and efficient population forced Switzerland to seek world markets. Thus, by importing raw materials and converting them into high-quality, high-value-added finished products for export, developing a highly organized and efficient transportation system and tourist industry, and establishing a free-market orientation, Switzerland generally has been able to keep unemployment low and inflation under control and has achieved among the worlds highest standards of living and per capita incomes.</p>
