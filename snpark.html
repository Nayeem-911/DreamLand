    <h2>Oldest National Park In Alps</h2>
    <img src="./img/snation.jpg" alt="Jungfrau image" class="image">
    <p>The Swiss National Park covers various terrains, from relatively low valleys to high peaks. The highest peak in the National Park is Piz Quattervals, 3165 m.a.s.l, which can be reached by an alpine hike. As of 2022, this is the only National Park in Switzerland. There are plans to create more. An Adula National Park was planned in the Adula Alps, but in November 2016 the inhabitants voted against it.</p> 
    <p>In the national park, it is forbidden to leave marked paths or to sleep anywhere apart from the Chamanna Cluozza, the mountain hut in the park. Due to this there are over 80 kilometers of marked hiking paths, separated into 21 individual hikes of various distances and difficulties. Dogs are not allowed, even on a leash. Due to these strict rules, the Swiss National Park is the only park in the Alps which has been categorized by the IUCN as a strict nature reserve, the highest protection level. <br>
    A visitor centre is located in Zernez. The road through the park leads over the Fuorn Pass (or Ofenpass) to South Tyrol in Italy. In addition to the Swiss National Park, there are sixteen regional nature parks in Switzerland. <br>    
    The Swiss National Park is home to several large animals. Visitors of the park will often hear and see alpine marmots. These may even be observed from very close up in one of the many designated resting places within the park. Other large animals include ibex, red deer, chamois, red fox, golden eagles and many more. Occasionally wolves and brown bears are also observed in the park but only rarely and these animals do not permanently reside in the park any more.</p>
    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>In the park, visitors have to follow strict rules. These rules are regulated in a special cantonal law by the canton of Grisons and enforced by park rangers throughout the park. If these rules are not followed, the park rangers may fine visitors up to 300 swiss francs. Some of the rules are as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>It is strictly forbidden to leave the marked paths as well as the resting areas marked with posts. The route of these paths is defined in cantonal law. Violating this rule will lead to a fine of 250 CHF.</li>
            <li>No litter. Violating this rule will lead to a fine of 100 CHF.</li>
            <li>No natural object may be picked or removed: animals, plants, sticks, stones, etc.</li>
            <li>Dogs are not allowed in the Park, not even on a lead.</li>
            <li>Entry in winter is forbidden.</li>
            <li>No winter sports, cycling or flying of any sort are permitted.</li>
            <li>Bathing in lakes, pools, streams and rivers is not permitted.</li>
            <li>No camp fires. Violation of this rule will lead to a fine of 300 CHF.</li>
            <li>Overnight stays are strictly forbidden, including in parked vehicles alongside the main Pass dal Fuorn road as well as bivouac.</li>
            <li>Nature must be left undisturbed.</li>
            <li>Flying drones of any kind is forbidden.</li>
        </ul>
